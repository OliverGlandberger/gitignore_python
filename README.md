# Basic `.gitignore` for Smaller Python Projects

## Introduction

This branch offers a "basic" `.gitignore` file, crafted for straightforward Python projects. It's ideal for small-scale applications, scripts, or when beginning a new project and you want to start with a clean and simple setup. This file aims to cover the most common files and directories that should be excluded from version control in many Python environments, providing a solid foundation for most projects without overcomplicating the ignored files list.

## Overview

The `basic.gitignore` file in this branch focuses on universally applicable rules suitable for a wide range of Python projects, particularly those without extensive dependencies or specialized tools. It includes exclusions for:

- **Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files**: Ignore Python bytecode and optimized code that can be regenerated easily.
- **C extensions**: Exclude compiled C extension files, which are platform-specific and should not be committed.
- **Distribution / packaging files**: Prevent common directories used for package distribution from being version-controlled, ensuring that only source code and essential resources are included.
- **Unit test / coverage reports**: Exclude artifacts generated by test runs and coverage analysis to maintain a clean repository.
- **Django-specific files**: While this branch aims for broad applicability, basic exclusions for Django projects are included given the framework's popularity.
- **Other common directories and files**: Cover additional common files and directories such as `.env` for environment variables, `.spyderproject` for Spyder IDE settings, and `.ipynb_checkpoints` for Jupyter Notebook checkpoint files, among others.

This `.gitignore` file serves as a strong starting point, and you may customize it further to fit the specific needs of your project.
